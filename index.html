                The Walking Dead is an amazing TV series that I watched a lot throughout high school. The action was what drew me towards the show.

                Bojack Horseman is realer than it comes across. It follows the journey of a former TV star who is desperately trying to relive the good old days while balancing his demons.

                As a techie and someone who loved psychological thrillers, Mr. Robot fulfills both of those itches for me. I loved the unreliable narrator angle of this show.
